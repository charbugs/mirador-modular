* It is not easy to keep track of all the state names in the implementation. There should be a global mapping of names related to state item (reducers, action types, state slices). This mapping should serve as single source of truth and a quick reference.

* It is not easy to handle layout updates when they are spread over arbitrary controllers. Better solution would be to have a single place for defining layout actions, either in the layout controllers or in the custom state of the implementation.
